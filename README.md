## Primitive Types Studies

This Java file serves as a focused cheat sheet and practical example repository for **Java's primitive data types** (byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char).

It includes detailed annotations and code snippets demonstrating:

- Default values and range limits for each type.
- Explicit and implicit type casting (widening and narrowing conversions).
- Common pitfalls and best practices when working with numeric primitives.

**Goal:** A quick, hands-on reference guide to solidify foundational Java knowledge.
